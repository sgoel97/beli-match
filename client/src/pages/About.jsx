          Welcome to BeliMatch, the innovative platform where food preferences
          forge the foundation of meaningful connections! Born out of a
          groundbreaking collaboration between students from MIT and UC
          Berkeley, BeliMatch was conceived at TreeHacks 2024, the premier
          hackathon event that brings together the brightest minds to solve
          real-world problems through technology.

          At BeliMatch, we believe that food is more than just sustenance; it's
          a universal language that connects people from all walks of life. Our
          mission is to harness the power of shared culinary tastes to bring
          individuals together, creating friendships, romances, and everything
          in between. Whether you're a vegan, meat-lover, gluten-free, or a fan
          of everything spicy, BeliMatch is here to help you find your perfect
          plate partner.
